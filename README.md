## Overview

Autohive is a smart parking system that uses ultrasonic sensors to detect the presence of vehicles and a servo motor to control the barrier. The system is designed to manage parking spaces automatically, providing real-time information about available parking spots.

## Features

- Automated barrier control based on parking space availability.
- Real-time display of available parking spaces on an LCD screen.
- Dynamic notification sounds for specific events.
- Simplicity in hardware and code structure.

## Requirements

To replicate this project, you'll need the following:

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Ultrasonic sensors (2)
- Servo motor
- Dynamic buzzer
- LEDs (red and green)
- LCD display (16x2)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard

## Setup

1. Connect the hardware components as per the wiring diagram.
2. Upload the provided Arduino sketch (`Autohive.ino`) to your Arduino board.
3. Power on the system and ensure that the components are working correctly.

## Usage

- The system will automatically control the barrier based on parking space availability.
- The LCD display will show real-time information about available parking spots.
- Dynamic notification sounds indicate specific events, such as no available parking.

## Code Structure

The code is organized into sections for setup, distance measurement, barrier control, and LCD display updates. Detailed comments are provided for better understanding.

## Testing

The project was tested with simulated data to ensure proper functionality. For testing instructions, refer to the [Testing](#testing) section in the code.

## Documentation
